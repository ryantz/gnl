ssize_t read(int fd, void buff[count], int count)

assume file opened
fd = -1 fail to open.
fd = open("file path", O_RDONLY);

buffer takes in a user defined BUFFER_SIZE from -D BUFFER_SIZE=n
if buffer does not end with a \n, store in a static buffer
else, return until string \n and store remainder in static buffer
read() again.


if buffer read till before \n

size: 13

test buffer 1\n -> buffer |test buffer 1
				  storage |test buffer 1
				  storage check for \n exist
				  no exist continue loop

test buffer 1\n -> buffer |\ntest buffer(space)
				  storage |test buffer 1\ntest buffer(space)
				  storage check for \n exist
				  if exist return until \n
				  increment storage pointer

test buffer 1\n -> buffer |1\ntest buffer
				  storage |test buffer 1\ntest buff

test buffer 1\n -> buffer |er 1\ntest buf
				  storage |test buffer 1

test buffer 1\n -> buffer |fer 1\ntest bu
				  storage |test buffer 1

				-> buffer |ffer 1\n
